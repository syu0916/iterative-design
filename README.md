# iterative-design
In this UI/UX project, we designed an interface for Koala, based purely off of their concept listed in YCombinator. We utilized Balsamiq to do low-fi mockups and figma to do high-fi mockups and prototyping. Check out our prototype here: https://www.figma.com/proto/psqMbI5HL6GUIdjiHnOaW5/Koala-Hi-Fi?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=205-192&viewport=352%2C128%2C0.07&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=205%3A192
